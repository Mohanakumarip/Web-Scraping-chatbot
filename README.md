# Web-Scraping-chatbot
Which is used to extract content from given website then it gives answers as per the questions about that website given by users.
**1. Code Implementation Details**
Step 1: Extract Content from the Website
•	extract_content(url): 
o	The function takes a URL as input, sends a GET request to fetch the HTML content, and parses it using BeautifulSoup.
o	It extracts text from all <p> tags (commonly used for paragraphs) and joins them into a single string.
o	If there's an error (e.g., HTTP error or timeout), it handles the exception and returns an error message.
Step 2: Preprocess Content
•	preprocess_content(content): 
o	This function trims unnecessary whitespace from the extracted content. Additional preprocessing (e.g., removing HTML entities or special characters) could be added here if needed.
Step 3: Build a Chatbot
•	build_chatbot(content): 
o	A pre-trained Hugging Face Question-Answering pipeline is initialized using the pipeline function.
o	The chatbot function uses this pipeline to process a dictionary containing: 
	context: The website's extracted and preprocessed content.
	question: A user-provided query.
o	The model generates an answer by identifying relevant parts of the context.
Step 4: Console-Based Chatbot Interaction
•	The program: 
1.	Accepts a URL from the user.
2.	Extracts and preprocesses content from the URL.
3.	Initializes the chatbot.
4.	Allows users to ask questions interactively in the console. The chatbot provides answers based on the extracted content until the user types "exit."

**2. Working Process**
1.	User Input: The user provides a website URL.
2.	Data Extraction: The content of the website is fetched and parsed using BeautifulSoup.
3.	Content Preprocessing: The extracted text is cleaned and formatted.
4.	Model Initialization: 
o	The Hugging Face pipeline function loads a pre-trained Question-Answering model.
o	The model uses the website's content as its knowledge base (context).
5.	Chat Interaction: 
o	The user inputs a question, which is sent to the Question-Answering model along with the context.
o	The model identifies the most relevant answer from the context and returns it.
6.	Output: 
o	The chatbot prints the answer to the user in the console.

**3. Execution Process**
1.	Install Python:
o	Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed.
2.	Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
3.	python -m venv venv
4.	source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
5.	Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the dependencies:
6.	pip install -r requirements.txt
7.	Save the Code: Save the Python code in a file, for example : chatbot.py also make sure file used for hugging face token file present in the same folder for example hugging_face_tokens.py.
8.	Run the Script: Execute the Python file:
9.	python chatbot.py
o	Enter a URL when prompted.
o	Ask questions interactively, and type "exit" to quit.


**Example Execution**
Input:
•	URL: https://example.com
•	User Questions: 
o	"What is this website about?"
o	"Who is the owner?"
Output:
•	Extracted Content: "Example Domain. This domain is for use in illustrative examples..."
•	Chatbot Answers: 
o	User: "What is this website about?" 
	Chatbot: "This domain is for use in illustrative examples..."
o	User: "Who is the owner?" 
	Chatbot: "The domain is owned by IANA."
